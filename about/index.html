	<p><strong>Using DERIVA for NIH Commons</strong></p>
	<p>The goals of this demo are to demonstrate how the DERIVA framework is ideally suited for fulfilling the goals of the NIH Commons Pilot.</p>
	
	<h3 name="commons">NIH Commons</h3>
	<p>
	The NIH Data Commons Pilot will test ways to store, access, and share biomedical data and associated tools in the cloud so that they are FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable). The goal of the NIH Data Commons is to accelerate new biomedical discoveries by providing a cloud-based platform where investigators can store, share, access, and compute on digital objects (data, software, etc.) generated from biomedical research and perform novel scientific research including hypothesis generation, discovery, and validation.</p>
	
	<h3 name="deriva">DERIVA</h3>
	<p>DERIVA is an asset management platform designed to support scientific collaboration through the full lifecycle of data - from early experiment design, to data acquisition, analyses and ultimately publication.</p>
	
	<p>DERIVA allows scientists, labs and organizations to:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Ingest and effectively describe diverse scientific assets.</li>
			<li>Organize and discover assets via rich metadata models.</li>
			<li>Store and retrieve assets quickly and easily.</li>
			<li>Integrate and share data collections.</li>
			<li>Enforce rights management/access control as needed.</li>
		</ul>
		
		<p>DERIVA combines a powerful entity-relationship database approach with a flexible, customizable user interface to link biomedical data and metadata to attributes users can find through search and filters in a familiar shopping-cart-like experience.</p>
