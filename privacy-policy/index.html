DERIVA and its applications may gather information about you and your use of the platform in order to improve your user experience and provide certain functionality. This policy provides information on how information is collected and used by systems built on the DERIVA platform. Additional policies may apply for specific DERIVA deployments.</p>
<h3>Types Of Information Collected</h3>

<h4>Data and Metadata</h4>
<p>In order to deliver data management services, DERIVA-based platforms may store information about data (metadata), or the data itself.  This data may be located in a third party storage provider (e.g. Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure). In these cases, data will be managed using best practice access control and security and access will not be provided to the storage provider.</p>
<h3>Use of Data</h3>
<p>Data is collected in order to improve your user experience and the overall function of the DERIVA software.</p>
<h4>Personalization of Features</h4>

<h4>System Improvement</h4>
<p>Data collected about your interactions with DERIVA-based systems may be used by the DERIVA developers to improve the design and implementation of DERIVA functions, or to evaluate and test new DERIVA features.</p>

<p>Data and Metadata stored within a DERIVA system may be stored even after deletion for purposes of backup and recovery for a period to time that will be stated for each DERIVA deployment.</p>
<h3>Mode of Processing the Data</h3>
<p>USC shall take appropriate security measures to prevent unauthorized access, disclosure, modification, or unauthorized destruction of the data.  In addition to USC, in some cases, the data may be accessible to certain types of persons in charge, involved with the operation of the site (administration, legal, system administration) or external parties (such as third party technical service providers, mail carriers, hosting providers, IT companies, or communications agencies).</p>
